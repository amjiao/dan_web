    <p> The prevailing circuit simulation paradigm involves first the extraction of the linear network. The extracted model of the linear network is then stitched with the nonlinear devices for the simulation of the entire circuit. Besides various inaccuracy issues due to circuit extraction and the stitching of circuit models, existing circuit simulators have not achieved optimal complexity. We developed an extraction-free circuit simulator that bypasses circuit extraction altogether.</p>

    <p>Guided by electromagnetics-based first principles, this extration-free simulator has not only accomplished an optimal complexity both in time and space, but also offered uncompromised accuracy and linear speedup in parallelization, overcoming the shortcomings of the existing extraction-based circuit simulation frameworks. Application to die-package co-simulation as well as very large-scale on-chip circuits involving close to 1 million CMOS transistors and interconnects having hundreds of millions of unknowns has demonstrated the superior performance of the new extraction-free circuit simulator.</p>
